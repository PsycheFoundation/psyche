# implementing models

This codebase includes a set of sample programs that let you design, implement, and test model architectures without spinning up the whole Psyche p2p training architecture.

We currently only implement Llama and Deepseek (see `shared/modeling/src/models/`), but PRs are very welcome to add more architectures and model types.

The `train` example, documented below, is useful to test how your model trains using AdamW vs DisTrO.

## Running

`$ cargo run --example train -- ---help`

You'll need a pre-tokenized dataset downloaded to your disk for training.

> A PR is welcome to add an option to the trainer to use the HTTP data provider! You can refer to the http example in the data-provider crate for a sample implementation.

For a Llama 2 model, a pre-tokenized dataset to test with is available at [https://huggingface.co/datasets/emozilla/fineweb-10bt-tokenized-datatrove-llama2/](https://huggingface.co/datasets/emozilla/fineweb-10bt-tokenized-datatrove-llama2/tree/main).
Psyche only needs the `.ds` files, and will load any/all `.ds` files in the specified folder - you can download just one for smaller tests.

If you've downloaded part or all of the above dataset into a folder `data/fineweb-10bt` inside the Psyche repo, you can start a simple training run on a 20m parameter Llama 2 model:

`$ cargo run --example train -- --model emozilla/llama2-20m-init --data-path ./data/fineweb-10bt/ --total-batch 2 --micro-batch 1`

## Adding a new model type

The `train` example currently asssumes your model is a Llama or Deepseek v2/v3 model, and instantiates it via `(LlamaForCausalLM|DeepseekForCausalLM)::from_pretrained`.

We currently only support causal language models - to implement a new one, you can create a file similar to `llama_for_causal_lm` and implement your model, ensuring you provide a trait impl for `CausalLM`.

You might also need to modify the data provider, if your data is structured in some way.
Since you're implementing the forward pass yourself, you can serve and interpret data passed from the data provider however you need.
The data provider currently only supports reading fixed-size batches from input files, so data batches with different sizes will require some additional work.

> PRs welcome for any new kinds of dataset loading!
