Why you’re histamine intolerant if you’re a woman
As a woman, we have estrogen to thank for our feminine characteristics. It’s the hormone that gives us our figure, our softer voice and allows us to have a family. Estrogen is an important part of a woman’s health and function, and imbalances have serious consequences for your overall well being.
Both low and high estrogen levels have profound and far-reaching effects, but it’s excess estrogen and its link to histamine intolerance that we want to discuss today. In fact, this link is so interesting that it explains why more women than men suffer with this debilitating condition...
Histamine and hormones: too much estrogen?
Often, we think of estrogen excess as the body making too much of the hormone. There is, however, another reason estrogen levels may increase, and that’s because of inefficient estrogen clearance.
If the body does not process estrogen effectively enough, levels will rise, and with it come those oh-so-familiar symptoms of estrogen imbalance.
If you’ve ever felt cranky, bloated, tired and your breasts hurt a couple of days before you begin your menstrual cycle, this is what I’m talking about. And, it has to do with the increase in estrogen production just before you start your period.
Now ,imagine what happens when your estrogen levels don’t drop down like they’re supposed to. These yucky PMS-like symptoms don’t go away!
By now you must be wondering: what does this all have to do with histamine?
Estrogen and histamine intolerance
The class of compounds that histamine belongs to are called amines. They, too, are hormones, like estrogen.
And, just like estrogen, histamine binds to specific receptors throughout the body to produce a response, which tell the body systems to do something.
Histamine receptors are denoted by H1-H4, and they are spread throughout the body1,2. H1 is the most widely distributed, and, get this, estrogen binds to it, just like histamine does3. There’s more: estrogen also promotes the release of histamine from some of your immune cells, called mast cells. They are the cells that carry histamine around to wherever the immune system tells them to go, to the site of the body where there’s a possible attack by a foreign invader4.
These mast cells, located all across the body,
