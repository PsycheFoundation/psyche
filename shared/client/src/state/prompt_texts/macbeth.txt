LADY MACBETH:
Did not you speak?
MACBETH:
When?
LADY MACBETH:
Now.
MACBETH:
As I descended?
LADY MACBETH:
Ay.
MACBETH:
Hark! Who lies i' the second chamber?
LADY MACBETH:
Donalbain.
MACBETH:
This is a sorry sight.
LADY MACBETH:
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
MACBETH:
Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
Chief nourisher in life's feast,â€”
LADY MACBETH:
What do you mean?
